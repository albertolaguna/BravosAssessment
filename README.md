## Backend

In order not to interfere with your global python environment, itÂ´s recommended to use a virtual environment and then install the requirements.

``` bash
cd backend
py -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to run the backend server, you just need to excecute the following commad

```bash
py dog_api_backend.py
```

## Frontend

Install dependencies and run the frontend by executing the following commands
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Consider you must run the backend server first in order it works.
